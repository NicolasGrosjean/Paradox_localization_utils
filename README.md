# Paradox localization utils

> A set of tools to manipulate Paradox localization files particularly for translating 

## Terms

* Source: It refers to the source language of your translation
* Destination (shorten dest): It refers to the destination language of your translation

Example : If I translate from English to French, the source directory refers to the directory of English localisation files.

## Installation

I recommend you to install a Python environment with conda, virtualenv or pipenv.

##### Conda
For example with conda, 
[download and install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Create a conda environment
```
conda create -n paradox_loc python=3.7.1
```

Activate the conda environment
```
activate paradox_loc
```

Install pandas package (only needed for *extract_existing_translation*)
```
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

### Update source

> Update the localization files of your source languages.
> It also copy in the parent of the target directory an extract of the source localization and all files in target_dir.

```
python src/update_source.py <source_dir> <target_dir> <source_lang>
```

Example to update the English files of the HoI4 mod Kaiserreich
```
python src/update_source.py <...>\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\394360\1521695605 <...>\GitHub\Traduction-FR-Kaiserreich\Traduction-FR-Kaiserreich english
```

### Add missing lines

> Add in the destination files the lines which are missing from the source ones

#### For Imperator Rome and sooner
```
python src/add_missing_lines.py <source_dir> <dest_dir>
```

Example to add in French files missing lines from English files
```
python src/add_missing_lines.py "<...>\game\localization\english" "<...>\game\localization\french"
```

#### For EUIV, HoI4 or Stellaris
```
python src/add_missing_lines.py <localisation_dir> <localisation_dir> -source_lang <source_lang> -dest_lang <dest_lang>
```

Example to add in French files missing lines from English files
```
python src/add_missing_lines.py "<...>\localisation" "<...>\localisation" -source_lang english -dest_lang french
```


### Add missing lines, files and update version

> Transform files of old directory to the new ones by adding missing lines and files, and updating version number.
> Other said, all is update excepted edited texts which are not edited.
> It is useful to have an intermediate version of source files between old and new version.

```
python src/add_missing_lines_files_update_version.py <old_dir> <new_dir>
```

WARNING: The files of old_dir are overriden so don't hesitate to have a backup before running this.

### Apply diff all

> Apply the differences between an old source version and a current source version to your current destination files.

#### For Imperator Rome and sooner
Not yet implemented

#### For EUIV, HoI4 or Stellaris
```
python src/apply_diff_all.py <old_localisation_dir> <current_localisation_dir> -source_lang <source_lang> -dest_lang <dest_lang>
```

* <old_localisation_dir> contains the localisation of the old source version
* <current_localisation_dir> contains the localisation of both new source version and old destination version

Example to apply in French files the modifications done in English
```
python src/apply_diff_all.py "<...>\V1\localisation" "<...>\V2\localisation" -source_lang english -dest_lang french
```

WARNING: The destination files are overriden so don't hesitate to have a backup before running this.

The new lines has a 'Z' instead of a version number.

The deleted lines are exported in the `<source_lang>_deleted_lines.txt` and `<dest_lang>_deleted_lines.txt` files.

### Extract existing translation

> Extract existing translation from another game or mod to apply to your translation

#### Limits
The target is EUIV or sooner whereas the source can be CK2/Vic2 or EUIV and sooner.

#### Usage
```
python src/extract_existing_translation.py <extract_source_dir> <extract_dest_dir> <target_source_dir> <target_dest_dir> <source_lang> <dest_lang> -source_col_ck2 <source_col_ck2> -dest_col_ck2 <dest_col_ck2>
```

Example to add in French CK3 files some texts from CK2 files.
```
python src/extract_existing_translation.py "<...>\CK2\localisation" "<...>\CK2\localisation" "<...>\CK3\localization\english" "<...>\CK3\localization\french" english french -source_col_ck2 1 -dest_col_ck2 2
```

Example to add in French HoI IV mod files some texts from Vanilla files.
```
python src/extract_existing_translation.py "<...>\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron IV\localisation" "<...>\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron IV\localisation" "<...>\mod\localisation" "<...>\mod\localisation" english french
```

### Extract Paratranz translation

> Extract translations from JSON files downloaded from [Paratranz](https://paratranz.cn) to apply to your translation.

#### Limits
This script only works for EUIV and sooner.

#### Usage
```
python src/extract_paratranz_translation.py <paratranz_dir> <localisation_dir> <language>
```

Example to extract french reviewed translations
```
python src/extract_paratranz_translation.py "<...>\paratranz" "<...>\localisation" french
```

By default it extracts only reviewed translation.
If you want to extract not reviewed translation, add `-extract_not_review` to the command.

Example to extract french translations (reviewed or not)
```
python src/extract_paratranz_translation.py "<...>\paratranz" "<...>\localisation" french -extract_not_review
```

### Copy localization in other languages

> Copy the localization of a language in other languages to allow to run your game/mod with this language with source texts instead of keys.

#### Limits
It works only for Imperator Rome and sooner.

#### Basic Usage [Windows only]
The usage is explicated in this [Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2342385980).

#### Developer Usage
 ```
python src/copy_on_other_languages.py <localization_dir> <source_lang> <dest_lang1> <dest_lang2> ... 
```

Example to add some languages to available only in English and French (the added languages will have English text). 
```
python src/copy_on_other_languages.py "<...>\MyMod\localisation" english korean german russian simp_chinese spanish
```

To compile it (after running once `pip install cx_Freeze`), use the following command
```
cxfreeze -c src/copy_on_other_languages.py
```

 
 ### Get duplicates keys
 
 > Get the list of duplicated keys in the localization to avoid localization erased by others.
 
 #### Limits
 
 The duplicated keys are searched in English localisation files only.
 
 #### Usage
 
 To get the full list of duplicated keys run the following command
 ```
python src/get_duplicates_key.py "<...>\MyMod\localisation"
```
 
 To get only the list of duplicated keys which already cause a bug
 (the value is not the same for each duplication), add *-only_different_value* to the command.
 
 
### [DEPRECATED] Apply diff for EUIV and sooner
```
python src/apply_diff.py <old_source_file> <new_source_file> <dest_file>
```

The destination file is override so don't hesitate to have a backup before running this.
The new and edited lines contains `:9 "`

Optionnal parameters :
* ```-space_prefix <value>``` : Prefix (generally spaces) before key in files
* ```-keep_edited``` : Keep destination value in case of edition.
The default behavior replace the destination value by the new source value.

Example to apply the English update from 0.11.1 to 0.11.2 to Russia file in French:
```
<...>\0.11.1\localisation\KR_Russia_l_english.yml <...>\0.11.2\localisation\KR_Russia_l_english.yml <...>\Translation_FR\localisation\KR_Russia_l_french.yml -space_prefix "  " -keep_edited
```
After running this, the new and edited lines need to be fixed by hand by seeking `:9 "`

## Tests

Go to the tests directory and run unittest
```
cd tests
python -m unittest discover
```
